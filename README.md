# Project log

## Overview

A simple hangman game where you have a certain amount of chances to guess a word.

## Details

-   This proyect is made in order to practice creative ways to write code. 

-   The intended user is anyone who wants to play the game.

-   Nobody sponsors this project. It is open source and it made to be published on Github.

-   The content requiered for this proyect is only the graphic content (drawing) which I already did myself.

-   The work that needs to be done is everything. The game is going to be coded from scratch. I coded a hangman game before, so I am going to use that old code as a reference.

## New Skills

For this proyect I am going to have to learn more about DOM. My other main goals are to use SASS as a CSS pre-processor and have a nice repo on Github with the whole process documentated.
