# Project log

## Overview

A simple hangman game where you have a certain amount of chances to guess a word.

## Details

-   This proyect is made in order to practice creative ways to write code. 

-   The intended user is anyone who wants to play the game.

-   Nobody sponsors this project. It is open source and it made to be published on Github.

-   The content requiered for this proyect is only the graphic content (drawing) which I already did myself.

-   The work that needs to be done is everything. The game is going to be coded from scratch. I coded a hangman game before, so I am going to use that old code as a reference.

## Time

-   Estimated: 20 hours over two weeks.

-   Actual: After 3.5 hours the project is working fine (keep in mind, that most of the js code was written before as an exercise). It could be done better (make it responsive / add features), but what I had in mind is done. From now on I'm just going to try other stuff to add on top of it. 

## New Skills

For this proyect I am going to have to learn more about DOM. My other main goals are to use SASS as a CSS pre-processor and have a nice repo on Github with the whole process documentated. 

## Challenges + Lessons Learned

-   Since I used a piece of code I've written before, this exercise was basicaly about aplying DOM and making the code more user friendly. However, the most valuable lesson learned in this exercise is to comment code. It took me quite a while to figure out how I approached the exercise a few months ago. And this was code I wrote myself!

## Archievements

-   Got better at writing HTML from JS.
-   Used svg in a very practical way.
-   Definately got better at commenting code.
-   Was consistent commiting progress and creating branches.
